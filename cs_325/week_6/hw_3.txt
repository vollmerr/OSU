2)  By definition of a simple path on a DAG that includes every vertex, there
    must be every vertex connected to only a single other vertex. There will be
    only a single (the last one) vertex with no adjacent vertex, and only a single
    vertex with no parent (the first one). This also means the number of edges must
    be 1 less than the number of vertex. If it is not, then there must be more than
    a single edge going to a given vertex, making it no longer a simple path.

  # graph G with G.V vertex, G.E edges
  SIMPLE_HAMILTONIAN(G)
    count = 0;
    # number of edges must be 1 less than number of vertex (constant)
    if G.E.length != G.V.length - 1
      return false
    # else go through all vertex (V runtime)
    for v in G.V
        # and make sure there is 0 or 1 adjacent (constant)
        if v.adj.length == 0
            count = count + 1
            if count > 1
                return false
        else if v.adj.length > 1
            return false
    return true

    All actions will take constant time other than looping through G.V, runtime will therefore
    be bounded above by O(V) (which is O(V+E)), and below by omega(1), as if it doesn't have
    the right number of edges/vertex it will run in constant time.

3)  a)

    b) CS 150, CS 151, CS 221, CS 222, CS 325, CS 351, CS 370, CS 375, CS 401, CS 425, MATH 200, MATH 201

    c) CS 150, CS 151, CS 221, CS 222, CS 325, CS 351, CS 370, CS 375, CS 401, CS 425, MATH 200, MATH 201

    d) CS 150, CS 151, CS 221, CS 222, CS 375, CS 401  => length of 5 (6 courses)

    Started at CS 150, determined how many possible outcomes following each path would bring. After CS 325
    it became impossible for longer length so stopped, as length of 5 already found, and only length of 4
    remained (as know that last 2 are not connected).

4)  a)  start by coloring the first vertex red. We will then color all adjacent vertex blue,
        if there are any vertex that are already red it is not possible. We will continue to swap betweeen
        coloring red and blue, checking for the opposite color.

    # graph G with G.V vertex, G.E edges
    COLOR_GRAPH(G)
      G.V[0].color = 'red'  # set first vertex to red
      for v in G.V.length   # go through all vertex
        for e in v.adj      # go though all adjacent vertex
          if v.color == e.color
            return "Not two colorable."
          if v.color == 'red'
            e.color = 'blue';
          else
            e.color = 'red';

    b)  Will take constant time for setting the first vertex to red, and all statements within
        the inner loop. Will go though all vertex in outer loop so O(V), each time looking at all
        edges connected so O(E), therefore will take O(V+E)

5)  a)  I would use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

            A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H     chosen  parent
        0   inf inf inf inf inf inf 0   inf   G       -
        1   inf inf 9   7   2   8   0   3     E       G
        2   inf 11  9   5   2   8   0   3     H       G
        3   inf 6   9   5   2   8   0   3     D       E
        4   inf 6   8   5   2   8   0   3     B       H
        5   inf 6   8   5   2   8   0   3     F       G
        6   12  6   8   5   2   8   0   3     C       D
        7   12  6   8   5   2   8   0   3     A       C

        (G,E), (G,H), (G,F), (H,B), (E,D), (C,A), (D,C)

    b)  Find the furthest point away from some vertex, repeat the same for that vertex,
        find the midpoint vertex of those two. Will modify Dijkstras to do this.

    # G=graph, s=source
    OPTIMAL_LOCATION(G, s)
      Q = []
      # get largest vertex, assumes a return
      # from Dijkstra of list of vertex
      v1 = Dijkstra(G, s)
      v2 = Dijkstra(G, max(v1))
      # iterate through parents to build list
      cur = max(v2)
      while cur != max(v1)
        add cur to Q
        cur = cur.p   # get next parent
      add max(v1) to Q
      # mid point is optimal, return that vertex
      return Q[floor(Q.length / 2)]

    c)  E, because it clearly must be one of the points located in the center due
        to the relatively close relations between distances. If you have E as the midpoint
        the furthest points away are:
          B=8, F=8, A=10
        If you move that point to G then A=12 which makes G less optimal.
        If you then choose D then B=11, which is also not optimal.
        You could repeat this process for any other point, but the same results will appear.
